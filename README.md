# bamazon

Bamazon is a command line interface virtual storefront Node app. It stores and retrieves SQL data based on user inputs and responses to Inquirer prompts.

The customer view allows the user to select from available products and choose a quantity. Bamazon checks to see if enough product exists and, if so, provides the customer with a total.

The manager view allows the user to view available products, view products with low stock, replenish stock on specific products and add new products.

To use Bamazon, the user will have to install the Inquirer and MySQL packages, and connect to the MySQL database by running the code in the bamazonseeds.sql file.

Packages used in Liri:
Inquirer
MySQL
